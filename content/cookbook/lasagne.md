    - 2 x 400 g tin chopped tomatoes
    - 4 dl milk
    - Salt
    - Black pepper
    - 50 g butter
    - 50 g flour
    - Pinch of nutmeg
    - 150g cheddar cheese, grated
    - 50g parmesan cheese, grated
    - Lasagne sheets
tools:
    - Frying pan
    - Saucepan
    - Baking dish
    - Spatula
    - Spoon
    - Whisk
instructions:
    - Set the oven to 225 ºC
    - Heat the olive oil in a hot pan.
    - Grate the onion and carrot and crush the garlic before frying together.
    - Season with the bay leaf, a pinch of oregano, Worcestershire sauce and a little salt and pepper.
    - Allow the onion to soften before making a well in the centre of the pan.
    - Place the mince in the middle of the pan and stir to break it up.
    - Add the tomato purée and allow to cook out for 30 seconds.
    - Continue until all the meat has browned nicely.
    - Add the wine and cook off the alcohol before adding the tomatoes.
    - Leave to simmer for a further 2-3 minutes. Finally add 1 dl milk, turn off the heat and set aside.
    - To make the cheese sauce, first melt the butter in a saucepan.
    - Add the flour and using a wooden spoon, stir to form a paste.
    - Over a gentle heat add a third of the milk, whisking to prevent any lumps forming.
    - Add the rest of the milk a third at a time, whisking as you go.
    - Season with salt and pepper and a pinch of ground nutmeg.
    - Allow the sauce to cook out for another minute before adding the Cheddar cheese.
    - Spoon half of the meat sauce into the bottom of the baking dish and place pasta sheets on top (break the sheets if necessary to avoid any overlapping).
    - Pour in just under half of the cheese sauce, and spread evenly using a spatula before spooning the remaining meat on top.
    - Add the final layer of pasta and use the spatula to pour over the remaining cheese sauce.
    - Finish with the grated Parmesan and sprinkle with another pinch of oregano, salt and pepper.
    - Place in the oven to bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.
