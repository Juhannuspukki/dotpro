    - 400 g crushed pineapple
    - 2 dl cream
    - Paprika
    - Pepper
    - Curry
    - Saffron
    - 4 dl milk
    - 50 g butter
    - 50 g flour
    - Pinch of nutmeg
    - 200 smoked cheddar cheese
    - 50g parmesan cheese, grated
    - Lasagne sheets
tools:
    - Frying pan
    - Saucepan
    - Baking dish
    - Spatula
    - Spoon
    - Whisk
instructions:
    - Set the oven to 225 ÂºC.
    - Fry the chicken on the hot pan.
    - When chicken is cooked, add the crushed pineapple.
    - Add cream and 50 g cheddar. Season with curry and other spices and mix well (nutmeg is used later).
    - Finally add 1 dl milk, turn off the heat and set aside.
    - To make the cheese sauce, first melt the butter in a saucepan.
    - Add the flour and using a wooden spoon, stir to form a paste.
    - Over a gentle heat add a third of the milk, whisking to prevent any lumps forming.
    - Add the rest of the milk a third at a time, whisking as you go.
    - Season with salt and pepper and a pinch of ground nutmeg.
    - Allow the sauce to cook out for another minute before adding the Cheddar cheese.
    - Spoon half of the meat sauce into the bottom of the baking dish and place pasta sheets on top (break the sheets if necessary to avoid any overlapping).
    - Pour in just under half of the cheese sauce, and spread evenly using a spatula before spooning the remaining meat on top.
    - Add the final layer of pasta and use the spatula to pour over the remaining cheese sauce.
    - Finish with the grated Parmesan and sprinkle with another pinch of oregano, salt and pepper.
    - Place in the oven to bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.
