Many of my relatives and friends have told me that in their opinion, it does not matter if someone reads their emails.
There is nothing of importance there, they tell me. Many of my friends consider themselves to be so unimportant people
that there is little reason for anyone to track their behavior. And moreover, if you haven't done anything wrong, why
would you have something to hide? Privacy is largely ignored as a value, and even if an unnamed social media giant
leaks the personal information of 86 million people for everyone to see the consequence is a shrug instead of a boycott.

Following this realization, I started pondering why do I protect myself with a VPN and an encrypted email service. Why
is privacy worth protecting? Is the entire concept obsolete? Wouldn't we have a better chance of capturing
terrorists, if the government had access to everything the citizens say or do? As an academic debater, I wanted to find
a more comprehensive and better-argumented response than the classical "if you truly have nothing to hide, give me all
your passwords and usernames right now". Eventually, I found several excellent scenarios of what might happen, if
privacy is lost. I am covering three of them in this post.

1. You said something stupid on the internet 10 years ago. Right now you are a candidate for a grand position in a big
company or campaigning to get to the European Parliament or some other position in which your loss of reputation would
be of benefit to someone else. Your rival candidate only has to dig up your embarrassing post... and you are no longer
a candidate to be taken seriously. The scariest thing about this is that the message doesn't have to be particularly
insulting. Many a message that has been conveniently taken out of context can be used for this purpose. Even deleting
the message might not always help: for example, Facebook has been known to keep copies of deleted messages and as a
result of bugs, they have resurfaced every now and then. Even though you had done everything properly and you have
absolutely no sensitive information anywhere, it might still not be enough to prevent blackmailing: if your rival
threatens to reveal a few bits of information about your sister, it's game over for you. I do have to say that this
scenario is not likely to take place unless you are running for the President of the Republic, but who knows what kind
of tasks await in the future?

2. You start receiving quite strange bills from online stores and final demands from loan sharks. You are, however, also
 quite sure that you have not ordered anything and consider it even more unlikely that you had taken loans. Eventually,
 you figure out that someone is pretending to be you, in other words, you are the victim of identity crime. It is
 remarkably easy to convince people and certain online services of your identity with the help of a few carefully
 chosen pieces of information. It is probably quite effortless to find the name of your first workplace, the make of
 your favorite bicycle and the name of your first school online. That information can be used the reset the password of
 certain services. In turn, those services reveal even more information about you. If all of this information is readily
 accessible on Facebook, it is even easier. When I was young, I and my friend tried to break into our classmate's email
 services by guessing the answers to their security questions. The probability of success was quite decent. About 160
 000 citizens of Finland have had their identity stolen at some point, and about half of them have suffered a financial
 loss as a result. Most of the victims cannot say where the information has come from but in a third of the cases,
 social media is assumed to be the main culprit.

3. What about privacy as a collective value? The past examples deliberated privacy from the viewpoint of the individual.
What if the government were to abolish the right to privacy? If the people give their government unlimited access to 
their data, the people also give the government enormous power since they will be able to dictate what information about
you is public and what is not. There is not a single case in the history of the world in which a government has failed
to misuse this power. If there is no right to privacy, the government can start blackmailing people to become moles and
whistle-blowers. At first, the reasons behind that are perfectly innocent, such as apprehending terrorists and criminals
and so on and so forth. In the end, however, we are looking at something like East Germany: a nation where everyone is
watching everyone else. Thus the right to privacy in the west is not a consequence of the west being a reasonably good
place to live in: The right to privacy is the very reason for these places being reasonably nice to live in.

Summa summarum: If an adult has read the aforementioned warnings and still thinks that privacy is meaningless, it's
his/her decision. As long as he/she does not handle other's sensitive information carelessly, no one has any right to
force him/her to do otherwise. On the other hand, there is absolutely no reason whatsoever for anyone to demand
abolishing privacy. The consequences of that would be simply frightening to think about.
