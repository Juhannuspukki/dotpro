I grew up in a small village with a small school in southern Finland. When I was at school, we didn’t have a qualified
sports teacher. It was understandable, since the place was pretty far from everything. Good thing we even had a local
school to begin with. When it was time to choose a new sports teacher, the class teacher with the most experience in
sports, a.k.a. _the district champion_ naturally got the post. It seemed like the most obvious and logical choice at
first, but it led to problems later.

Many people tell me that exercise and sports make them feel good in some way. To this date, I have no idea of what they
are talking about: it’s always just pain to me and this is why I have regrettably always hated all sports with the
exception of swimming. Apparently district champions in sports are as ignorant of the pain as I am of the good feeling
that supposedly comes with exercise.

Now, here’s the problem: a district champion has most likely always been in a very good shape. Therefore, he/she does
not have any understanding whatsoever of a person who is not in a good shape, at least not without having been educated
on the subject. Education... the very thing all my sports teachers lacked. Being pushed too hard at school leads to
thousands of kids swearing never to do sports again every year. This is not exactly a good thing for the public health
expenses or the life expectancy of the country.

Ten years later I was accepted to study at a university. It didn’t take me long to realize that every teacher in the
place was a district champion. Just not at sports, but at science. There are a few who naturally excel at teaching, but
mostly they are just scientists. I quickly learned to dislike mathematics, which I had always liked.

So, what can we learn about these experiences? Personally, I think we don’t give good teachers enough credit. After all,
a teacher who is good at teaching makes you more interested in the subject: a teacher that is knowledgeable of the
subject but bad at teaching alienates you from the subject.
