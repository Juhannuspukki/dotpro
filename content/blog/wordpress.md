Steve Jobs died on the fifth of October, 2011. Nineteen days later Simon & Schuster released his biography, simply
titled _Steve Jobs_. Like many other people, I read it as soon as I could get my hands on a copy. I did not have to read
for long before I found the first chapter that was quote material. This is how Jobs describes the work of his
adoptive father, Paul:

_"If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him.”
Fifty years later the fence still surrounds the back and side yards of the house in Mountain View. As Jobs showed it
off to me, he caressed the stockade panels and recalled a lesson that his father implanted deeply in him. It was
important, his father said, to craft the backs of cabinets and fences properly, even though they were hidden.
“He loved doing things right. He even cared about the look of the parts you couldn’t see."_

Relentless and sometimes even unhealthy attention to detail was something that characterized Jobs during his life.
