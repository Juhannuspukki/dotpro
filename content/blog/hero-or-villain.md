title: Why businesses either die a hero or live long enough to see themselves become the villain

As a Finn, Nokia has been a big part of my life even though I have never worked there. At the height of its power,
Nokia single-handedly generated 4% of Finland's GDP. There are ex-Nokia people in every IT company in Finland and
summer trainees hear all about the good old days. So, back in 2017, a documentary was made about the story of the
company. I decided to pay a few euros to see it at a local theatre since I found the topic moderately interesting...
and I was going there anyway to see the new Blade Runner movie. They discussed the stories of company culture,
successes, and personal stories. I did not learn much since I had been reading the IT news daily ever since the
third grade. I remembered a lot of stuff that was not covered in the documentary. I remember the "two turkeys don't
make an eagle" statement from Google after the partnership with Microsoft was announced. I also remember how every
Lumia model got great reviews and how they were always sold out in the U.S. and how Nokia hired Nicki Minaj to promote
them. Yet the sales were plummeting, and we know the rest. There was, however, one scene in the documentary that struck
me as eye-opening. I have wanted to quote it several times during the years, but it took me ages to find it since for
some baffling reason it was cut from the international version. The scene describes how fear affects people's behavior.

_The survivor feels that there are "me and not-me". This is why survivors are attracted to gangs and mobs where they seek shelter and safety. These people are never seen in leadership positions._

_If we proceed, we meet the rule-followers. They fear much less since they have clear rules to follow. They believe in priests, the police, the president and whoever guides them forward in life. The rule-followers also think that people who think like them are right and the rest are automatically wrong._

_Next, there is the success step. These people seek success by any means necessary, be it money, fame or power. They are very competent, work a lot, attend many schools and always seek to portray themselves as extremely proficient and competent even if they sometimes were not. They love degrees, titles and they also have a lot of friends, all of whom are also successful. Success-oriented people are attracted by change, they love transitions and a success-oriented person thinks that "both me and you exist, but I win". A success-oriented person works to become successful him/herself, not for the community to become successful._

_When the maturity level has increased a bit from that, a big change ensues. It is the start of a "we"-centric phase, or humane people. A humane person thinks that "both me and you exist, but I know what you think and feel". They look for the meaning of life, the nature must be protected, one must feel comfortable at the workplace, they genuinely care about other people. The humane people are also the most creative of all and they genuinely work for the community and the company. Their success results from the success of the company or community._

_So, how does this manifest itself in the world of business? It can be seen in the fact that we have three kinds of companies. We have rule-following companies, success-oriented companies, and humane companies. In the 90s, Nokia was a humane company. People cared about each other, worked together, had this real teamwork thing going on. Nokia was innovative since humane people are very creative. Many new things were released to the market and it was not always calculated how much profit you could make as long as the product was as good as possible. Soon, nasty things happened when the majority of shares was sold to the USA and Nokia regressed. Nokia became a success-oriented company. The humane people who worked at Nokia started to experience discomfort. Nokia started to pursue maximum profit and play it safe, "in case we won't succeed anymore". Let's make the next product just a bit better than before and play it safe, so we can maximize our profits and make the investors happy._

Just think of any small, innovative company whose products you enjoy using. The company was most likely founded by
creative, humane people and it can remain as a humane company for a long time. However, if the company becomes
successful it starts to attract success-oriented people.
Eventually a few of them manage to worm their way in and hire more of their kind. That is how regression starts and before
you know it, you are swearing at the latest version of their product since the new management decided to cut a few
corners for the sake of those much-needed cost-savings.
