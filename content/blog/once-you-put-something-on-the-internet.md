title: Once you put something on the internet, it doesn't stay there long enough

On the 2nd of April, 2012, I visited the App Store and bought a game for 79 cents. The game was Infinity Blade, one of
the first games that hinted that smartphones were capable of running games that were console-quality. Infinity Blade
had excellent graphics and I enjoyed playing so much that I bought the sequel three days later. IB2 was even better
and more story-driven than its predecessor. It was also the first IOS game to receive a 10/10 rating from IGN. A year
later, IB3 was released and I made sure to get it on the first available opportunity. I also read the Infinity Blade
novels that further expanded the story and explained the origins of the game world. I think it's safe to say the IB
series is one of the best I have ever played.

10th of December, 2018. Epic Games announces that the IB series will no longer be available on the App Store due to
difficulties in updating them for newer hardware. Infinity Blade 3 only survived for 5 years. Even though you can keep
playing if you have the game on your device, this made me think about how short-lived our digital culture can be.

Let's say you buy an ebook. You will be able to read it until the company that sold it to you loses the license to
sell you that book. This might happen for a number of reasons: currently, the most prominent one is the publisher
starting their own store or streaming service. If you do not have the book downloaded to your reading device, poof.
It's gone and you have to buy it again from somewhere else. The same goes for movies: unless you keep the DRM-free
data file, you may lose access to the movie at any time without prior notice. I don't think the average Joe even
knows if his movies are stored locally or not.

I have four aquariums. Aquariums usually have timers that keep the lights off during the night and turn them on for
the day. When I was shopping for timers for my tanks, Amazon recommended me IoT timers that can be programmed and
remotely controlled with a smartphone app. You can now mentally compare adjusting timer settings on the screen of
your phone to crawling on the floor with a flashlight to adjust your traditional timer. The benefits are obvious,
but there are drawbacks as well. What if the company ceases to develop the mobile app? Your timers will become bricks.
One might think this is only the case with no-name Chinese manufacturers, but even Logitech bricked their perfectly
functioning Harmony Link universal remote systems in 2018. The reason was an expiring security certificate which the
company considered to be too expensive to be renewed.

They say that once you put something on the internet, it stays there forever. Funnily enough, it seems that "forever"
is not quite long enough for some things. Sometimes even physical devices break because of it. The thing I most worry
about is games: open source software can help alleviate the problems with IoT devices and erasing all copies of a movie
or a book is pretty much impossible, but what is to become of games? PC games have the longest lifespan, but even they
will suffer once the gap between software and hardware becomes big enough. It's not likely for all games to become
open-source either. No company can be expected to maintain a game forever, but they are still an important part of
our culture. I can only hope that a solution will be found and I can keep playing games just like I can pick up a
good book from the library over and over again. Preferably without specialized hardware.
