What are Finnish taxis like?

For one, the car always seems to be a new BMW, Audi or Mercedes-Benz. A premium or luxury car, that is. This was at
least before Uber and other such services existed. Now taxi drivers suddenly find their vehicles to be empty when
customers choose cheaper rides instead (even though it would be in a 15-year-old Toyota Corolla). If people need
to get from A to B, they don't care how to get there as long as the ride is cheap and fast.

Why do taxi drivers prefer these expensive cars? They could drive something cheaper, lower their prices and become more
competitive with Uber-like services. I have two explanations that are not mutually exclusive: A) they spend a lot of
time in their taxis and the extra cost genuinely provides extra comfort for them and B) they simply like cars and
assume that everyone else also likes cars. Therefore a ride a in a premium car provides extra value for them.

There is a similar phenomenon in the IT field. The overwhelming majority of people use computers as tools to create
something: music, presentations paintings, documents, spreadsheets, videos, blogs and so on and so forth. And then
there are the people who simply like computers and tinkering with them (read: Linux users). Their idea of fun is not
using the computer as a tool but improving and fine-tuning the software and hardware of computers. They love the
process, not the result. Computers, like the cars of taxi drivers, are ends in themselves, and there is absolutely
nothing wrong with that! However, problems arise when these worlds clash.

In my mind, I refer to these two user groups as primary users (using a product for the sake of the product) and
secondary users (using a product as a tool for something else). The division is not exact, but more like a gradient.

Why does any of this matter? Because people choose their careers based on what they are interested in. If you are 
interested in tinkering with computers (primary user), you are also likely to pursue a career with computers. If you
like socks more than anything, you are likely to pursue a career in the sock industry. If you are interested in planting
crops and growing things, you might end up as a farmer or a gardener. If you like cars, you might become a taxi driver.
However, the odds are that your customer is not a primary user. They don't care at all about your product, only the
indirect value it can provide for them. Let's say I'm selling you a website. I can say:

_I am offering you a static site. It will be using Hugo, a static site generator with 35 000 GitHub stars. It is quite
fast and it only takes it under a millisecond to create a page. You will be able to update it by either adding new
markdown files to the content folder or by using Netlify CMS, a content manager that automatically creates Git
commits for your updates._

Or I can say:

_I am offering you a very fast, hack-proof, maintenance-free website that is easy to update. A < 2 second loading time
ensures that your customers won't abandon it. You also won't need to spend any time or money on fixing security
vulnerabilities. A large developer community ensures that you won't get vendor-locked._

I could go on about the benefits a while longer, but you get the idea. The first description is not bad if I am selling
to a primary user. They like tech and know the benefits without me spelling them out. However, a person who is not
interested in websites (except as a tool) only cares about the indirect value, even if they are able to understand
tech jargon. This is why many very competent professionals are such lousy salesmen. 

Many people also ask their friends for recommendations on different products. Usually, it is the secondary user asking
the primary user. This is problematic since the users most likely value completely different features on the product.
If the primary user cannot tinker with it, the product is automatically bad. If the secondary user has to spend most of
the time tinkering with it, it is also bad. This is why many very competent professionals are such crappy service
designers.

So, today's lessons could be summarized as follows: people need to understand that just because they are interested in
a product does not mean that everyone is. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with either mindset.
